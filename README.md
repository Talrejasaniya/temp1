# 🌦️ Weather Prediction Using Naive Bayes

This is a machine learning project to classify weather types (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Snowy) using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

## ✅ Features Used
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Precipitation (%)
- Cloud Cover
- Season
- Location

## 🔍 Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Selection
- Label Encoding
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification
- Evaluation with Accuracy & Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy: 83.44%
- Confusion matrix shows high performance on “Snowy” and some confusion between “Rainy” and “Cloudy”.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Data preprocessing (cleaning + encoding)
- Naive Bayes works well for simple, fast classification
- How to interpret confusion matrices and performance metrics

## 🛠️ Tools
Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
